"""Queue-worker runner.

State machine:
  chilling  → check usage at HH:00 (top of every hour);
              if usage_left >= 30% AND reset < 70min → burning
  burning   → process tasks one-by-one until reset time (burn_until);
              usage check after each task finish;
              after the currently-running task finishes past the deadline,
              transition back to chilling.

Reset anchor: a `next_reset_at` epoch is tracked across cycles. The canonical
re-anchor is the post_reset check at T+5min. Other checks (manual, hourly
fallback, pre_reset before post_reset has succeeded) can re-anchor inside a
±15min sanity band — wildly different proposals are logged and rejected, so
a single noisy fetch can't repaint truth. Burn decisions use min(fetched,
anchor) so a stale anchor cannot fire a burn that fresh evidence already
contradicts.

run_once mode bypasses the state machine and drains the queue once
(used by CLI --once and web "Run All (once)" button).
